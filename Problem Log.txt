HOME PAGE
=========
Really great layout of home page, well done.

I think you need to bring your brand out bigger
> "SOStimate" needs a big banner and logo, maybe something with a clock or stopwatch?
(something likr https://www.alamy.com/with-clock-sirine-character-cartoon-style-vector-illustration-image185368087.html)
> Make the size of logo about as big as the logo here: https://www.taxi-zentrale.at/

MAP PAGE
=========
Excellent, easy-to-use and intuitive

Would it be a good idea to add a "BACK" button 
on this and all other sub-pages that you have created?


ABOUT PAGE
==========
Great, very clear

I would create a separate page for accessibility, and
add "Accessibility" onto the top bar menu on the Home
page after Visualizations.


VISUALIZATIONS PAGE
==================
Could you have a button on each page "Select All"

Can you make the radio buttons bigger? They are really fiddly
particular for someone with fine motor control issues, e.g. 
for someone who has had a stroke, or has dyspraxia.


============================

-> Change to horizontal bar chart; Ambulance and fire different colours - Hue is volume
-> Change to average minutes - Count under 5 minutes, etc.
-> The big picture on home
-> Add faces and info
